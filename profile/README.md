## Hey there 👋

🐙 I've been contributing to GitHub since 2014 and now work as a full-time open-source maintainer.

💚 I've been involved in the development of [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt) since 2017.

💛 And i make open solutions in [UnJS](https://github.com/unjs), which includes **50+** libraries with **395+ million** monthly downloads on NPM.

❤️ Your [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/pi0) means a lot to me and supports what I do.

💬 You can find me in X/twitter via [@_pi0_](https://twitter.com/_pi0_), discord via `@pi0` or email via `pooya@pi0.io`.
